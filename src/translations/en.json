No anesthesia is used on the 8th day, as the risk from anesthetics is higher than the pain from the cut. The pain in small babies is minimal because their pain sensation is not fully developed. The baby usually calms down after a few minutes. At the parents' request, an anesthetic can be applied externally in the form of ointment, drops, or suppositories. Normally, I perform Brit Milah alone on children up to 6 months of age. At the parents' request, a doctor can be involved, but it is better for the baby to be circumcised closer to the 8th day when the pain sensation is less developed.",

If the bandage falls off or slips, please contact me. The bandage is removed after one day. The baby is bathed and the bandage is soaked off (about 10 minutes). A slight redness of the diaper during diaper changes is normal, as the urine dissolves the blood in the bandage. To prevent the bandage from sticking, you can apply some baby oil.",

An uncomfortable feeling may occur in the first few days. The stitches dissolve on their own after an average of 7-12 days. Chamomile baths can promote the healing process. Showering is usually allowed 3 days after the procedure, while a full bath should only be taken after the stitches have completely dissolved."

This is the opinion of Prof. Abraham Steinberg from Israel, who has conducted research on this topic for years. Due to the simplicity of the procedure, very young doctors with little experience are usually assigned to perform it in hospitals. The doctor uses clamps to stop the bleeding, which causes more pain. The procedure also takes longer because the doctor lacks routine. The Mohel specializes in this type of procedure. His movements are practiced, and everything happens very quickly, so the child experiences minimal stress and pain. Halachically, a surgeon may be qualified to perform the circumcision operation, but that does not mean he can perform the covenant of circumcision.",

                "'Every male among you shall be circumcised. And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.' (Genesis 17:10).",
                "After this important test of Abraham's circumcision - Abraham underwent a total of ten tests - G-d changed his name from Abram to Abraham. G-d added the 'he' from His own holy name. Because Abram acted obediently, he became Abraham, the bearer of promise - father of many nations.",
                "In the Torah's second commandment, we see the importance G-d places on circumcision for His people. Our sages also explain that the three most important commandments of the Torah can be derived from the word Shabbat - in Hebrew, shin, bet, tav. Shin for Shabbat, bet for Brit Mila - circumcision, tav for Tefillin - phylacteries. Three commandments as signs of the covenants that G-d made with His people.",
                "In practice, this is evident as Jews have circumcised their sons on the eighth day, as commanded by G-d, for approximately 3700 years, under the most difficult external conditions. (Genesis 17:12). In cases of illnesses like fever and jaundice, Halacha allows for a delay. At eight days old, the baby does not have fully developed nerves for pain sensation. This is confirmed by known medical studies. In comparison to Islam - where circumcision is also practiced according to the biblical story of Ishmael - it is performed up to the age of 13 years in Islam. However, circumcision of girls cannot be derived from any part of the Torah and has therefore never been practiced in Jewish communities.",
                "Jewish history reports only one period during which the sons of Israel were not circumcised, during the 40-year journey through the Sinai desert. Joshua had to circumcise all the men of the people before they could cross the Jordan. Uncircumcised men are called by a special name in Hebrew, almost a curse word in the community of Israel: 'Arel.' Such a man is excluded from certain occasions according to Torah law, e.g., as a member in forming a Minyan, being called to the Torah reading, or participating in the Passover celebration, although he is Jewish by birth.",
                "Until a few years ago, circumcision was the most important and sometimes the only possible commandment that all Jewish parents, religious or non-religious, observed. Unfortunately, this has changed, especially in the former communist countries - particularly the CIS states. Circumcision is even openly argued against. One concern is the procedure itself, which is feared and rejected, even though it is one of the easiest surgeries. However, when a doctor orders circumcision for medical reasons, no objections are raised.",
                "As a counterexample, circumcision is increasingly practiced by non-Jews in America. One reason is that no circumcised man has ever developed penile cancer. The wives of circumcised men have significantly fewer genital diseases. All male members of the British royal family have been circumcised for generations.",

                "A local anesthesia injection with 1% lidocaine is recommended for adults. For a baby, the injection is much more painful, and injuring the fine blood vessels can cause necrosis. The medication also enters the bloodstream, potentially disturbing the heart and circulation, causing blood pressure drops and hearing impairments. Only a doctor should administer this medication.",
                "Another form is lidocaine ointment. This has the advantage that the medication does not penetrate the skin into the body and thus into the bloodstream. For a few seconds, the baby feels less pain during and after circumcision. However, the ointment does not eliminate all sensations. Some pain remains, and the effect varies among children. The ointment must be applied at least an hour beforehand.",
                "A third means of pain relief is a sugar medication, 'Sachros,' with very good effects for most children. As it is a liquid to be taken orally, it is easy to administer, e.g., on a pacifier, immediately before the procedure. Like the ointment, it does not provide 100% anesthesia. Some pain remains. Another variant is the administration of tablets or suppositories, as with other pain treatments. The medical effects are not fully known, and these medications have other side effects.",
                "As with all daily life topics in Judaism, there are halachic opinions and discussions here as well. In the first centuries, circumcision was performed without anesthesia for children and adults. Later, general anesthesia or at least local anesthesia became common for adults. Normally, children from six months to ten years old undergo general anesthesia, and from ten years onwards, local anesthesia is used. Only in the last generation has there been a rabbinic debate about whether halachically, anesthesia ointment is allowed for infants up to six months, as well as other forms of anesthesia for children and adults. The result is three opinions:",

The Midrash also states: When a child cries and suffers, one should think of one's own sufferings and problems and wish for the child that the momentary pains are the only ones it will have, thus also for its parents.",

                        "The commandment 'Circumcision of the foreskin' may be fulfilled even if no pain is felt. However, the fulfillment of the commandment is only given when one feels the cut, the first blood - one or two drops - is sucked away, and the rest of the foreskin is pushed to the body, leaving the glans exposed.",

Additionally, neither the Torah nor the Talmud nor the Kabbalah indicate that pain is necessary for the circumcision to be kosher, i.e., valid. The only indication for the opposite is the aforementioned Midrash. Even babies treated with ointments or drops experience residual pain. For those who believe that pain is necessary for circumcision, this should suffice. For general anesthesia in adults, there are Talmudic sources suggesting that the appointment for circumcision can be made before going to sleep, and the act is valid.",
                "In conclusion, it must be noted that there is a significant difference between circumcision performed by a doctor and by a Mohel. This opinion is supported by Prof. Abraham Steinberg from Israel, who has conducted extensive research on this topic. He also believes that, in hospitals, young doctors with little experience in this procedure are often assigned. The doctor uses clamps to stop the bleeding, which leads to increased pain. The procedure also takes longer due to a lack of routine. The Mohel is specialized; everything goes very quickly, and the child suffers minimally. Usually, it sleeps shortly afterward and eats normally. No change is noticeable in its life rhythm. According to Prof. A. Steinberg, anesthetic ointments or mild sedatives may be used.",
                "In summary, the fear of Brit Mila presents no objective reason against it! Medical reports and statistics further show that there have been no serious incidents in recent years. During this period, many circumcisions have been performed on adults - due to immigration from the CIS states - differing only in healing duration. Jewish sources also report no incidents during circumcisions.",
